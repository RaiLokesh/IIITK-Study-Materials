<br><br>
Hey everyone,
<br><br>
I'm creating this web app to keep track of all study materials we recieve in each sem. Everyone can upload materials to this site, which can again be used by everyone. Incase someone needs any particular file in future they can get it from here. 
<br><br>
So it is basically "By the Students, For the Students :)".
<br><br>
I am creating a "Rainy Theme" in which y'all will hear the rainfall in the background while you are on this site. This will help you focus while studying. Use Microsoft Edge or any other Browser than Chrome for best experience ( as Google Chrome sometimes blocks autoplay music in background :/ ).
<br><br>
I have made this project with React JS and Google Firebase.
<br><br>
